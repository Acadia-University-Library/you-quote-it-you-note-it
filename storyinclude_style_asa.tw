This is not plagiarism.

Copying information word-for-word from a source is okay as long as you put \
quotation marks around the copied information and give credit to the source.

entirely in your words&mdash;just changing a couple words here and there \
doesn't cut it.

! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

Maybe it would help to show the difference between quoting and paraphrasing, and \
how to do each correctly using ASA style.

Here is a passage from a journal article that you could use in your paper:

> Since YouTube creators enjoy the reputation as reliable endorsers, companies \
search for appropriate influencers in the social media sphere in hope of finding \
credible people disseminating their brand's message.


/**************************************/
::style_asa_quotvpara_02_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Quoting

A quotation uses exactly the same words as those found in the source material \
and puts them in quotation marks. Here's what a quotation looks like with a \
proper in-text reference in ASA style:

> "Since YouTube creators enjoy the reputation as reliable endorsers, companies \
search for appropriate influencers in the social media sphere in hope of finding \
credible people disseminating their brand's message" (Schwemmer and Ziewiecki \
2018:4).

/**************************************/
::style_asa_quotvpara_03_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Paraphrasing

A paraphrase is another authorâ€™s ideas expressed //in your own words//&mdash;\
without quotation marks, since it's no longer a word-for-word quotation. And \
just changing a few words from the original doesn't count!

> Many companies seek out YouTubers with good reputations to promote their \
brand and their products (Schwemmer and Ziewiecki 2018:4).

Now that you know the difference between quoting and paraphrasing, let's make \
sure you can do it properly in an actual assignment. Imagine that this is your \
essay so far:

> Product endorsement is increasingly common on YouTube. ''Since YouTube creators \
enjoy the reputation as reliable endorsers, companies search for appropriate \
influencers in the social media sphere in hope of finding credible people \
