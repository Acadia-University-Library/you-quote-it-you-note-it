En fait, ce n’est pas du plagiat, c’est de la paraphrase.

Il est tout à fait acceptable de paraphraser, pourvu que vous indiquiez la \
source et que la paraphrase soit entièrement dans vos mots – changer quelques \
mots ici et là ne suffit pas.

::fr_style_mla_quotvpara_01_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

Maybe it would help to show the difference between quoting and paraphrasing, and \
how to do each correctly using MLA style.

> In //The Pastures of Heaven//, readers first see the natural and poetic use \
of language familiar in Steinbeck's greatest works.



::fr_style_mla_quotvpara_02_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Quoting

A quotation uses exactly the same words as those found in the source material \
and puts them in quotation marks. Here's what a quotation looks like with a \
proper in-text reference in MLA style:

> "In //The Pastures of Heaven//, readers first see the natural and poetic use \
of language familiar in Steinbeck's greatest works" (Burkhead 17).
> ...
> Works Cited:
> <span class="hanging_indent">Burkhead, Cynthia. \
//Student Companion to John Steinbeck.// Greenwood, 2002.</span>



::fr_style_mla_quotvpara_03_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Paraphrasing

A paraphrase is another author’s ideas expressed //in your own words//&mdash;\
without quotation marks, since it's no longer a word-for-word quotation. And \
just changing a few words from the original doesn't count!

> The first use of Steinbeck's works to use language in the poetic way for which \
he became famous is //The Pastures of Heaven// (Burkhead 17).
> ...
> Works Cited:
> <span class="hanging_indent">Burkhead, Cynthia. \
//Student Companion to John Steinbeck.// Greenwood, 2002.</span>

! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Quoting

Let's look at an example in context:

> Steinbeck's early works betray an undeveloped style. ''In //The Pastures of \
Heaven//, readers first see the natural and poetic use of language familiar in \
Steinbeck's greatest works.''
