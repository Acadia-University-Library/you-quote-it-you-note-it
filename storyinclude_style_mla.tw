Actually, this is not plagiarism: it's paraphrasing.

Paraphrasing is fine as long as you credit the source and the paraphrase is \
entirely in your words&mdash;just changing a couple words here and there \
doesn't cut it.

! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

Maybe it would help to show the difference between quoting and paraphrasing, and \
how to do each correctly using MLA style.

of language familiar in Steinbeck's greatest works.


/**************************************/
::style_mla_quotvpara_02_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Quoting

A quotation uses exactly the same words as those found in the source material \
and puts them in quotation marks. Here's what a quotation looks like with a \
proper in-text reference in MLA style:

> "In //The Pastures of Heaven//, readers first see the natural and poetic use \
of language familiar in Steinbeck's greatest works" (Burkhead 17).
> ...
> Works Cited:
> Burkhead, Cynthia. //Student Companion to John Steinbeck.// Greenwood, 2002.


/**************************************/
::style_mla_quotvpara_03_include
! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Paraphrasing

A paraphrase is another authorâ€™s ideas expressed //in your own words//&mdash;\
without quotation marks, since it's no longer a word-for-word quotation. And \
just changing a few words from the original doesn't count!

> The first use of Steinbeck's works to use language in the poetic way for which \
he became famous is //The Pastures of Heaven// (Burkhead 17).
> ...
> Works Cited:
> Burkhead, Cynthia. //Student Companion to John Steinbeck.// Greenwood, 2002.
