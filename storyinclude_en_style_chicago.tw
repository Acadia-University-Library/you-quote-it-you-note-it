entirely in your words&mdash;just changing a couple words here and there \
doesn't cut it.

! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

Maybe it would help to show the difference between quoting and paraphrasing, and \
how to do each correctly using Chicago style.

Imagine that this passage from an eBook is one that you would like to use in \
your essay.

> The form of rule established by Diocletian at the end of the 3^^rd^^ century \
was effectively a rule of four: two Augusti (principle emperors) and two Caesares \

!! Quoting

A quotation uses exactly the same words as those found in the source material \
and puts them in quotation marks. Here's what a quotation looks like with a \
proper in-text reference in Chicago style:

> "The form of rule established by Diocletian at the end of the 3^^rd^^ century \

! Quoting and Paraphrasing: Differences

!! Paraphrasing

A paraphrase is another authorâ€™s ideas expressed //in your own words//&mdash;\
without quotation marks, since it's no longer a word-for-word quotation. And \
just changing a few words from the original doesn't count!

> A tetrarchy was used to rule Rome for a time at the end of the 3^^rd^^ century \
and into the 4^^th^^. This form of rule consisted of one emperor in the east and \
one in the west, known as Augusti. Each of these emperors had a second in command \
known as a Caesar, who would eventually gain the throne upon each emperor's \
retirement or death.<sup>1</sup>
